            <h2>Name: Luca Maximilian Buchwald</h2>
            <h2>Age: 17</h2>
            <h3>I'm a 17 years old student who has been born in germany. <br>In the year of 2020 I started teaching myself programming in the age of
                14 and started working on little applications in java. <br>The first languaes I've been learning have been HTML, CSS and Java (not Javascript)<br>
                and about a year later I started learning C++ and Python. <br>
                When I don't know something the first thing I do is to learn it and that's what I did all the years till today.
